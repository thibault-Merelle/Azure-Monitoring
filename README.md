# Azure monitoring
### Microsoft Azure proposes over 6000 services...:eyes: And they are AWESOME!!! But how to manage them and take care of the cost? Let us introduce : Azure monitoring :fireworks: :fireworks: :fireworks:  

We created an app which is monitoring the resources our school is using while we are getting a new exciting career as Cloud Developers.
### Technologies  üñ•Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏èüñ±Ô∏è
- Azure, Azure and once again Azure: Logic App, Function App, Data Factory, Blob Storage, Azure SQL
- Python
- Pandas
- Node.js
- React
- Express
- Axios

### Idea :bulb: 
Once a week we receive an email with the information about consumption of Azure recourses. With Logic app we monitore email from specific address, and as soon as it arrives our logic app saves the attachment to Azure Blob Storage. From there it has been picked up by our Function app written in Python which is converting .xlsx file to .csv and cleans it up. Then, the file is transferred with the help of Data Factory to the SQL Database. 
The front of our app is created with React, for the back we use node.js and express. 

### How to use?
Coming soon...
